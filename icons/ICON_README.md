# Icon Instructions

The extension requires PNG icon files. You have two options:

## Option 1: Use an Online Converter

1. Upload `icon.svg` to a service like https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
2. Create three versions:
   - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
   - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)
3. Save them in this `icons/` folder

## Option 2: Use a Design Tool

1. Open `icon.svg` in a tool like:
   - Inkscape (free)
   - Adobe Illustrator
   - Figma
2. Export as PNG at the three required sizes
3. Save them in this `icons/` folder

## Quick Alternative

For testing purposes, you can create simple colored square PNGs:

- Any image editing software can create simple 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files
- Just use a blue background (#2563eb) with a lock emoji or text

The extension will work once these PNG files are in place!
